      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="823">Possibly: A Discourse concerning, I. The true import of the words election and reprobation; and the things signified by them in the Holy Scripture. II. The Extent of Christ's Redemption. III. The Grace of God; where it is enquired, Whether it be vouchsafed sufficiently to those who improve it not, and irresistibly to those who do improve it; and whether Men be wholly passive in the Work of their Regeneration? IV. The Liberty of the Will in a State of Trial and Probation. V. the perseverance or defectibility of the saints; with some Reflections on the State of Heathens, the Providence and Prescience of God. By Daniel Whitby, D.D. and Chantor of the Cathedral Church of Sarum. (London : Printed for John Wyat, at the Rose in St. Paul's-Church-Yard, M DDC X.
