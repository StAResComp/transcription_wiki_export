      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="661">Possibly: Mathematical Principles of Theology, or, the Existence of God Geometrically Demonstrated in Three Books. Wherein is Proved, The Existence of God from Eternity to Eternity; his Self-existence, Independency, and Unity. That God is infinite in Wisdom, Power, Knowledge, &amp;c. Also, That Matter is a temporary Being; that God is the Cause of its Existence, and of the Existence of all other Beings, that ever did, or can exist ; and upon God the Continuation or Termination of their Existence depends.
