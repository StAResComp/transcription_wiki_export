      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="684">Possibly: Observations on divers passages of Scripture. Placing many of them in a light altogether new; ascertaining the meaning of several not determinable by the methods commonly made use of by the learned; proposing to consideration probable conjectures on others, different from what have been hitherto recommended to the attention of the curious; and more amply illustrating the rest than has been yet done, by means of circumstances incidentally mentioned in books of voyages and travels into the East: in two volumes. (By Harmer, Thomas). (London : Printed for J. Johnson, No. 72, St. Paul's Church-yard, M DCC LXXVI. [1776]). http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2408639~S1</text>
