      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="738">Possibly: 	A vindication of the fundamental charter of presbytery, from the exceptions of the country-man, in his letter to a curate. Wherein these queries are considered; I. Whether it was the constant and uniform practice of our reformers, to join in the communion of the Church of England, when they had Occasion? II Whether our reformers, in their Public Deeds, openly and solemnly professed, that they were of one communion with the Church of England? III. Whether the English liturgy was used in Scotland, for several Years, by our reformers? By a true son of the afflicted Church of Scotland.
