      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="873">Probably:  The beauties of biography: containing the lives of the most illustrious persons who have flourished in Great Britain, France, Italy, and other parts of Europe, either as poets, historians, divines, philosophers, soldiers, or politicians. In which all superfluous matter is avoided, and every thing interesting, entertaining, or curious, carefully preserved. Extracted from the Biographia Britannica, Baile's Dictionary, and other valuable works, for the instruction of youth of both sexes, and calculated to inspire them with a love of virtue, and create a spirit of emulation absolutely necessary to those who would wish to arrive at any degree of superiority in their different professions, or amusements. (London : Printed for G. Kearsley, at No. 46, near Serjeant's Inn, in Fleet-street, MDCCLXXVII. [1777]) http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2429481~S5</text>
