      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="880">Possibly:  	The families of plants with their natural characters, according to the number, figure, situation, and proportion of all the parts of fructification. Translated from the last edition, (as published by Dr. Reichard) of the genera plantarum, and of mantissae plantarum of the elder Linneus; and from the supplementum plantarum of the younger Linneus, with all the new families of plants, from Thunberg and L'Heritier. To which is prefix'd an accented catalogue of the names of plants, with the adjectives apply'd to them, and other botanic terms, for the purpose of teaching their right pronunciation. By a Botanical Society at Lichfield. (Carl von Linn√©).  2v. (Lichfield : Printed by John Jackson. Sold by J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church-Yard, London. T. Burne, Dublin. And J. Balfour, Edenburgh, MDCCLXXXVII. [1787]).  http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2500559~S1</text>
