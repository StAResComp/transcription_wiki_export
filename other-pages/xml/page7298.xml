      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="887">Possibly: The Odes, epodes, and carmen Seculare of Horace, Translated into English Prose, As near as the Two Languages will admit. Together with the Original Latin from the Best Editions. Wherein The Words of the Latin Text are put in their Grammatical Order; the Observation of the most Valuable Commentators, both ancient and modern, represented; and the Author's Design and Beautiful Descriptions fully set forth in a Key annexed to each Ode and Poem; with Notes both Geographical and Historical. The Whole adapted to the Capacities of Youth at School, as well as of Private Gentlemen. By David Watson, M.A. Of St. Leonard's College, St. Andrew's. Revised by a Gentleman will-skilled in this sort of Literature at London. (London : Printed for J. Oswald, at the Rose and Crown, near the Mansion-house, Stocks-market, MDCCXLI [1741]). http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2012641~S1</text>
