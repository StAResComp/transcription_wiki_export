      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="884">Possibly: An apology for the conduct of Mrs Teresia Constantia Phillips, more particularly that part of it which relates to her marriage with an eminent Dutch merchant: the whole authenticated by faithful copies of his letters, and of the settlement which he made upon her to induce her to suffer (without any real opposition on her part) a sentence to be pronounced against their marriage; together with such other original papers, filed in the cause, as are necessary to illustrate that remarkable story. By Teresia Constantia Muilman. (London : Such extraordinary care has been taken to intimidate the booksellers, in order to stifle this work, that Mrs. Phillips is obliged to publish it herself, and only at her house in Craig's Court, Charing Cross; and to prevent imposition, each book will be signed with her own hand, 1748.) http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2054991~S1</text>
