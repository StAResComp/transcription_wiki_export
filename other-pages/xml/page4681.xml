      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="780">Possibly: An Introductory Discourse to a Larger Work, Designed hereafter to be Published, concerning the Miraculous Powers which are supposed to have subsisted in the Christian Church, from the earliest Ages, through several successive Centuries; Tending to shew, That we have no sufficient Reason to believe, upon the Authority of the Primitive Fathers, That any such Powers were continued to the Church, after the Days of the Apostles. With a Postscript, containing Some Remarks on an Archdiaconal Charge, delivered the last Summer by the Rev. Dr. Chapman, to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of Sudbury. By Conyers Middleton. (London : Printed for R. Manby and H. Cox, at the Prince's Arms, on Ludgate-Hill, M.DCC.XLVII. [1747]) http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2408431~S1</text>
