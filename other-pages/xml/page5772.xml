The heavenly bodies, elements, meteors, fossils, vegetables, animals, (beasts, birds, fishes, and insects); more particularly in the body of the earth, its figure, motion, and consistency; and in the admirable structure of the bodies of man, and other animals; as also in their generation, &amp;c. With answers to some objections. By John Ray, late Felow of the Royal Society. (London : Printed by William and John Innys, printers to the Royal Society, at the West-End of St. Paul's, M DCC XXII.
