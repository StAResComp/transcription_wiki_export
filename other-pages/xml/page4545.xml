      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="702">Possibly: The Christian's Magazine, or Treasure. Containing, a choice collection of many remarkable passages upon several important religious subjects, taken out of the writings of some of the most eminent divines: tending to our confirmation both in the belief and practice of the true Christian religion, against atheists, deists, socinians, papists, and other corrupt and loose Christians. By James Mauclerc, M.D. One of the oldest members of the Royal College of Physicians. (London : Printed for the author, By S. Richardson; and sold at this house in Orange-Street near Leicester Fields, and at the Sign of Eramus's Head, in the Strand, [1754?]) http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2409548~S5</text>
