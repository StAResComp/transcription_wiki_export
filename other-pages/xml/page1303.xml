      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="735">Possibly:  The motion of fluids, natural and artificial; in particular that of the air and water, in a familiar manner, proposed and proved, by evident and conclusive experiments with many useful remarks. Done with such plainness and perspicuity, as that they may be understood by the unlearned. For whose sake there is added, a short explanation of such uncommon terms, which in treating on this subject could not, without affectation, be avoided. With plain draughts of such experiments and machines, which, by description only, might not readily be comprehended, by Martin Clare.
