Sterling to L. 18 Scots or 30 s. Sterling, each table advancing by 1 s. Scots or 1 d. Sterling per boll; and also at L. 3: 3: 4, L. 3: 6: 8, L. 3. 13s. 4d. and L. 3: 16: 8, up to L. 18 Scots per boll, and from 4 1/2 to 27 merks, (the prices at which grain is sold in Scotland): the whole consisting of 361 different tables : with rules and examples to make them answer for calculating the price of all sorts of goods sold by number, weight, or measure / by John Thomson Writer in Edinburgh ; together with, A table reducing English libels and quarters to the Edinburgh standards or Linlithgow measure; and, A comparison of the weights and measures of Scotland with those of England, as regulated by the statutes of both kingdoms now in force ; very useful for noblemen and gentlemen, and their stewards or factors; for farmers, brewers, and bakers; and for merchants and shopkeepers.
