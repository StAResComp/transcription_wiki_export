      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="888">Possibly:  	Notes critical and explanatory on the Books of Psalms and Proverbs ; intended to correct the grammatical errors of the text from the collations of the Mss. by Dr. Kennicott on the Psalms, and by him and de Rossi on the Proverbs; and to restore and elucidate some corrupt and obscure passages, by comparing the mss. with the antient versions, the parallel places of scripture, the proposed emendations of many able critics, and submitting some Further Conjectural Readings to the Judgment of the Learned. By the Rev. H. Dimock, M. A. rector of St. Edmund the King, and St. Nicholas Acons, London; and late of Pembroke College, Oxford. (Henry Dimock).  (Glocester : Printed by R. Raikes. And sold by J.F. and C. Rivington, St. Paul's Church Yard, London ; J. and J. Fletcher, Oxford ; and J. Hough, Glocester, MDCCXCI [1791]).  http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2510571~S1</text>
