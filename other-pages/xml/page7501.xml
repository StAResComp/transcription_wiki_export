      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="771">Possibly: Parentalia: or memoirs of the family of the Wrens; viz. of Mathew Bishop of Ely, Christopher Dean of Windsor, &amp;c. but chiefly of Sir Christopher Wren, Late Surveyor-General of the Royal Buildings, President of the Royal Society, &amp;c. &amp;c. In which it is contained, besides his works, a great number of original papers and records; on religion, politicks, anatomy, mathematicks, architecture, antiquities; and most branches of polite literature. Compiled, by his son Christopher; now published by his grandson, Stephen Wren, Esq; with the care of Joseph Ames, F.R.S. and Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries, London. (London : Printed for T. Osborn, in Gray's-Inn; and R. Dodsley, in Pall-Mall, MDCCL. [1750]). http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2039742~S1</text>
