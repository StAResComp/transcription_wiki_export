In which their literal or historical sense, as they relate to King David, and the people of Israel, is illustrated; and their application to Messiah, to the Church, and to individuals, as members thereof, is pointed out: with a view to render the use of the psalter pleasing and profitable to all orders and degrees of Christians.
