      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="925">Possibly: 	Stemmata Latinitatis; or, an etymological Latin dictionary: wherein the whole mechanism of the Latin tongue is methodically and conspicuously exhibited, upon a plan entirely new, and calculated to facilitate the acquisition, as well as to impress the knowledge, of the language. With a key, or an introduction, ascertaining not only the origin, but the value, of the several terminations and prepositive particles. Also, a general index of every Latin derivative and word entering into composition. By Nicholas Salmon, author of the complete system of the French language, &amp;c. In two volumes. (London : Printed for the Authors, by W. and C. Spilsbury; and sold by C. Dilly, Poultry; Elmsley, Strand; Debrett, Piccadilly; Hookham and Carpenter, New Bond Street; Johnson, St. Paul's Church Yard; Edwards, Pall Mall; and Thomas Payne, Mews Gate, M.DCC.XCVI. [1796]). http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2452712~S1</text>
