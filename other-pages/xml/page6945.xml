      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="665">Possibly: The Gentleman's guide, in his Tour through France. Wrote by An Officer in the Royal-Navy, Who lately travelled on a principle, which he most sincerely recommends to his Countrymen, viz. Not to spend more money in the Country of our natural enemy, than is requisite to support with decency the character of an English Man. (Bristol : Printed by S. Farley, in Castle-Green, and sold by T. Cadell, Mrs. Palmer, and A. Brown; also by A. Millar, in the Strand, and G. Kearsley, on Ludgate-Hill, London; Mr. Fletcher, in Oxford; Messrs. Fletcher and Hodson, in Cambridge; and Smith and Son, in Dublin, [1766]). http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2435003~S1</text>
