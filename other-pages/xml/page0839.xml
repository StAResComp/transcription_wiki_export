In a series of exemplifications, from an initial one for a beginner at school, to such as are applicable to the capacities and circumstances of young academics, in order to form a proper habit of thinking, and writing, at an early time of life. For the use of youth in the lesser schools. (By Henry Bright). (Oxford : printed at the Clarendon-Press: and sold by Mess. Prince and Cooke, Mess. Fletchers, Mr. Arnold, and Mr. Bliss, Oxford; Mess. Rivingtons in St. Paul's Church-Yard, and Mr. R. Blamire the Corner of Northumberland-Street in the Strand, London; and Mess. Merrill, Cambridge, MDCCLXXXIII.
