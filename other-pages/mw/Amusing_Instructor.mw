Possibly: The amusing instructor; or, a key to the Italian classics: containing a choice collection of remarkable sayings, and anecdotes, in Italian and English. Wherein the genuine pronunciation of the Italian is rendered obvious at sight, by means of proper characters. Also, an ode on liberty, ascribed to Petrarch; and an elegant sonnet, hitherto unpublished, on the suppression of the celebrated academy Della Crusca. With an imitation of each in English verse, by a distinguished pen. The whole preceded by a copious and critical treatise on the pronunciation of the Italian tongue, by the editor, Antonio Montucci, LL. D. A native of Sienna, and a graduate of the University of that City. (London : Printed for the editor, No. 2, Lyons Inn, M.DCC.XCII. [1792]). http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2486822~S1
