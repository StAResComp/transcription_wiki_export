<p>Possibly: The Hebrew text considered; being Observations on the Novelty and Self-Inconsistency of the Masoretic Scheme of pointing the sacred Hebrew Scriptures; with a reasonable account of the author's plan of reading and constructing the Scriptural Hebrew without points. Founded upon an attentive consideration of the Genius of the Hebrew text itself, unpointed as at first written; the obvious dictates of nature; the known usage of language in general; and the unexceptionable authority of the Antients. By Norman Sievwright, A.M. A Presbyter of the Church, and Minister to the Authorized Episcopal Congregation in Brechin. (London : printed for A. Millar in the Strand; and C. Wright in Edinburgh, M.DCC.LXIV. [1764]). <a href="http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2489283~S1">http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2489283~S1</a></p>
